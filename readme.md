This is an attempt to create the google homepage from scratch, using all the skills that I picked up. 

My goal was to use one html file, and not create a seperate CSS file to make this. Looking back, a seperate CSS file would've made the code look cleaner.
In addition to the above lesson, I have learnt a lot over the past few days. Specifically, wrapping my head around Flexbox and CSS grids, which seemed to be confusing and complex at first, were things I enjoyed finally understanding. 

This was my first website. Hopefully, there will be many more in the future.
